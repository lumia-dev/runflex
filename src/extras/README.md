The aim of that folder is to put FLEXPART source files specific to a local machine/project. For instance, the size of some arrays in `par_mod.f90` may need to be modified depending on the memory available on the machine, and it wouldn't make sense to commit these tweakings in the git repository.

At compilation, the files in the main source folder (defined by the `path.src` rc-file key) are first copied in the build directory (defined by `path.build` in the rc-file). Then, the files in this folder are copied to the same build directory, and overwrite those from the main source directory (provided that the `path.src.extras` rc-key points to here).
